minibook
--------

A cross-platform desktop Facebook (FB) status updater and lister 
written in Python. Uses PyFacebook to make FB API calls.


Requirements
------------

python
pygtk
pyfacebook: http://github.com/sciyoshi/pyfacebook/tree/master

minibook should run on all platforms where these are available,
currently tested on Linux and Windows XP.

How to use it for your own good?
--------------------------------

Every application has to register on FB, cannot just fool around...
The FB API uses two keys, an API_KEY and a SECRET_KEY to check the 
application making any API request on behalf of the user. The API_KEY is 
unique for an application, the SECRET_KEY makes sure that other people 
cannot hijack the identity of the app. Thus FB does not allow the 
SECRET_KEY to be made public.

The only problem is, that in an Open Source desktop app, this is not 
possible...

Then there is only one solution (I know of at the moment): everyone has 
to have their own version of the application... (silly, isn't it?)

So, to use this project, you have to do the following:

1) Create a new application on FB
http://www.facebook.com/developers/
Set it's type to "desktop".

2) On your app's page, note the "API Key" and "Application Secret".
Put them in a file called "config" in the root directory of minibook. 
The first line is the "API Key", the second is "Application Secret".

3) Setup the permission for this app to update your status. See:
http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Extended_permission
More specifically, point your browser to this address:
http://www.facebook.com/authorize.php?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&v=1.0&ext_perm=publish_stream
where you replace "YOUR_API_KEY" appropriately

4) Install dependencies, specifically PyFacebook

5) Run app, if everythings fine it should start the browser to log you 
in, after which you can update your profile!
